This project includes steps necessary to integrate CLI generated **Angular** project inside **ASP.NET Core** Project. 
The primary goal is to continue to develop both projects as one project inside **Visual Studio 2017**. 
I have listed a couple of steps necessary to perform such integration in the form of some reminder or cookbook (see Cookbook.md).

Feel free to correct me or (better yet) to propose a better and quicker way of doing this initial phase of 
setup and merging ASP.NET Core and Angular. And yes, thats how this project gets its name: CoreWithAngular.

Cheers!
